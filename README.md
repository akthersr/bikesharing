# Bikesharing

## Overview of the project

Two tourists from Des Moines,Iowa was fascinated by the NYC Citi Bike sharing service during their last summer trip to New York City and plan to launch a similar business in their hometown. But before analysis, we must keep in mind that New York City is well-organized before Des Moines. Where, Manhattan very densely populated and concede high traffic tourist areas to run this kind of expansion service for tourists and daily commuters. So our goal is to convince the potential investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this analysis is to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, by using Tableau Public to impress potential investors, to solidify the proposal.In this visualization, we are going to use the data from August month, because there is more traffic during the summer months.

The visualization of the story can be found here.

## Results

### Tripduration

Using Python and Pandas functions, we convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype and create a dataframe from the data (201908-citibike-tripdata.csv) source.

### August Peak Hours

The following bar chart shows that, the top riding hours during August in New York City are 5:00 p.m to 7:00 p.m and the ideal time for bike maintaince are between 
2:00 a.m. to 5:00 a.m. According to the analysis we found that,this was the least active time for bike riding.
