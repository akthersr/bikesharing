# Bikesharing

## Overview of the project

Two tourists from Des Moines,Iowa was impressed by the NYC Citi Bike sharing service during their last summer trip to New York City and plan to launch a similar business in their hometown.But, we have to keep in mind that New York has been well organized before Des Moines.Where, Manhattan is very densely populated and high traffic tourist area to run this kind of expansion service for tourists and daily commuters.Now, we have to convince the potential investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal.

## Purpose

The main purpose of this analysis is to create effective visualizations from the Citi Bike data, by using Tableau Public to impress potential investors, to solidify the proposal.In this visualization, we are going to use the data from August month, because there is likely more traffic during the summer months.

The visualization of the story can be found here.
